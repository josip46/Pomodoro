It's an app that helps you learn through pomodoro technique

Pomodoro technique is learning technique where you learn and take breaks of certain amount. 

How to use it:
When you click start the timer will start and count 25m minutes in which time you should be productive(studying/work). After 25 minutes you get a 5 minute break. This circle repeats 4 times before it's time for a big break of 20 minutes. After each work cycle you also get a checkmark so you can track your progress.
